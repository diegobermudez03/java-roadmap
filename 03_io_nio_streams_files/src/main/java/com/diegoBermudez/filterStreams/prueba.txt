Moment of Glory es un álbum de estudio de la banda alemana de hard rock y heavy metal Scorpions y la Orquesta Filarmónica de Berlín, publicado en 2000 por EMI Classics. En 1995, la orquesta escogió a Scorpions para realizar un crossover que unificara la música clásica con la popular. Después de considerar al británico Andrew Powell y luego al estadounidense Michael Kamen, al final el austríaco Christian Kolonovits asumió el cargo de director de orquesta y arreglista. En 1998, el cancilThe Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.[1][2][3] Developed by Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon, the series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Set in the fictional town of Springfield, it caricatures society, Western culture, television, and the human condition.

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to "simpleton".[4] The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).[cita
